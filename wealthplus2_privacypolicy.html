<h2>Privacy Policy: Wealth+ 2</span></h2>

Updated on July 1, 2019: Launch of Wealth+ 2.

<br><br>By Andrew Little

<br><br>In all of the apps that I create, trust and privacy is of paramount importance. The apps are never trying to be subversive when it comes to your personal data, and are designed only for your enjoyment. This policy lays out the details of how your privacy is protected in Wealth+.

<br><br><h3>Financial Data</h3>

In Wealth+ 2, we utilize the Google Cloud Platform, specifically Firebase Firestore, as the system of record for your data. Only you will be able to read the data stored in the system, and your personally identifying information will not be stored with the financial data. Your password will be stored by Google, fully encrypted. We promise that your data will never be sold.

<br><br><h3>Usage Analytics</h3>

Only for the purposes of improving the functionality of Wealth+, the app conducts limited usage tracking and sends the data to Google (Firebase Analytics). The usage tracking never includes any of your financial data and does not include any personal identifiable (PI) information (in fact, we don't have access to any PI by design, except for your email address used to sign up). You are able to disable Usage Analytics at any time (from the More menu), to ensure you have complete control over the app's data collection.

<br><br><h3>Account and Data Delete</h3>

You are able to delete all of your data, including financial, at any time. Please note that this operation cannot be undone.

If you have any questions, please contact me personally at projectdosomething@gmail.com - Wealth+ is part of the Little Apps family of apps. My goal is to make this policy as clear as can be.

<br><br>Sincerely,

<br><br>Andrew Little</p>
