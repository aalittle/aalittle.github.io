Most enterprise teams are optimizing for imaginary futures instead of real presents.

The best product teams know when to stop designing and start learning.

Design partners matter. Customer research helps. But eventually, you have to make a bet and ship something real.

Einstein captured it best: "Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler."

Enterprise software teams often do the opposite.

- We build flexibility before anyone asks for it.
- We add configuration for theoretical use cases.
- We ship frameworks when customers just wanted features.

**The Paradox:** Simple products get adopted faster. Adoption means you learn faster. Learning means you build the right product later.

You're not cornering yourself by starting simple. You're creating space to discover what flexibility actually matters.

Steve Jobs understood that innovation is saying "no" to a thousand things. So, ship the core workflow first. Watch real usage. Add the knobs only when customers prove they need them.

**Speed to learning > Speed to perfection.**

Get something good into the market and let behaviour guide what comes next.

That's how you build something many people adopt, instead of something few people configure.

*What's a feature you built for a "future use case" that never actually happened?*
