I lead 60+ engineers spread across India, Israel, and North America. Three regions. Eight hours of time zone spread. Different cultures, different working styles, different expectations.

Here's what I've learned about making it work.

## Co-location still matters

This might sound contradictory. But the single most impactful change we made was ensuring every team is co-located within their region.

We used to have teams with members scattered across multiple cities. A team lead in Halifax, two engineers in Tel Aviv, one in Bangalore. The coordination overhead was brutal.

Now, every team sits together in one city. Cross-team collaboration happens asynchronously between regions. Within-team work happens synchronously in person.

The result: cycle time dropped 45%. Pull request review time fell from days to hours.

## Autonomy requires clarity

Distributed teams need more structure, not less. When you can't tap someone on the shoulder to clarify requirements, the requirements need to be airtight.

We invested heavily in High-Level Design documentation. Every feature starts with a written spec that answers:

- What problem are we solving?
- What's the proposed solution?
- What are the alternatives we considered?
- What are the open questions?

The HLD gets reviewed asynchronously before any code is written. By the time engineers start building, there's shared understanding across all three regions.

## Hire regional leaders who can operate independently

Your Israel lead shouldn't need your approval for every decision. They need context, goals, and trust.

We do weekly syncs to align on priorities and surface blockers. But day-to-day execution is delegated completely. My job is to ensure the regional leads have what they need to succeed, then get out of their way.

The hardest part was letting go. I used to review every significant PR. Now I review maybe 5% of them. The quality didn't suffer. It actually improved, because the regional leads developed stronger ownership.

## Optimize for the handoff

The magic of global teams is continuous progress. When Halifax signs off, Tel Aviv picks up. When Tel Aviv signs off, Bangalore continues.

But this only works if handoffs are clean. We use a simple protocol:

1. End-of-day Slack summary: what got done, what's blocked, what's next
2. Linked PRs and documents for anything in progress
3. Explicit ownership transfer for time-sensitive items

No handoff should require a meeting. If it does, something is broken.

## Cultural differences are real

Israeli engineers will tell you directly when they think your idea is wrong. Indian engineers might agree in the meeting but raise concerns privately later. North American engineers fall somewhere in between.

None of these styles is better. But if you don't understand them, you'll misread the room constantly.

I spend time in each region every year. Not for status updates—I can get those on Zoom. For the hallway conversations that reveal what people actually think.

## The bottom line

Distributed teams are harder. There's no getting around that. But they also give you access to talent you'd never find in a single geography.

The key is treating distribution as a design constraint, not an obstacle. Build systems that assume asynchronous communication. Hire leaders who can operate independently. Invest in clarity upfront so execution is clean.

When it works, it's a genuine competitive advantage. Our teams ship around the clock, and our regional leads bring perspectives I'd never have on my own.
